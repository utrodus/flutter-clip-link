## Routes

The **routes** folder serves as the central point for managing the navigation in the app. It contains two main files that handle the application's routing: `routes.dart` and `router.dart`.

`routes.dart`

The `routes.dart` file stores all the **route names** used throughout the app. Each route has a unique string identifier that will be used to navigate between pages or screens in the application.

Example Structure of `routes.dart`:
```dart
class AppRoutes {
  static const home = '/home';
  static const settings = '/settings';
  static const profile = '/profile';
  static const login = '/login';
}
```
In this file, route names are defined statically to ensure consistency and prevent duplication of string literals throughout the app.


`app_router.dart`

The `app_router.dart` file is responsible for **router configuration** using the **go_router** package. In this file, all the routes defined in `routes.dart` are configured to allow smooth navigation between screens in the application.

GoRouter is used to manage navigation logic, including conditional routes, dynamic routes, and nested routes.

Example Structure of `app_router.dart`:
```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'routes.dart';
import 'package:your_app/pages/home_page.dart';
import 'package:your_app/pages/login_page.dart';

final GoRouter appRouter = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: AppRoutes.home,
      builder: (context, state) => HomePage(),
    ),
    GoRoute(
      path: AppRoutes.login,
      builder: (context, state) => LoginPage(),
    ),
    // Add other routes here
  ],
);
```

In this file, each route from `routes.dart` is connected to its corresponding widget, such as `HomePage()` or `LoginPage()`. GoRouter also supports more complex route management, such as passing parameters or handling nested routes.
